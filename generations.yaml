generations:
  - name: "First Generation"

    description: "The original Honda HR-V was a pioneering compact crossover SUV introduced primarily for the Japanese and European markets. Featuring distinctive boxy styling with a high roofline, it was marketed as a 'Joy Machine' that combined car-like handling with SUV versatility. Available in both three-door and five-door configurations, it was built on a modified Honda Logo platform. Powered by a 1.6L VTEC four-cylinder engine with either front-wheel drive or Honda's Real Time 4WD system, it emphasized on-road performance rather than serious off-road capability. The interior featured a car-like dashboard with a relatively high seating position providing the commanding view preferred by SUV buyers. Though not a strong seller globally, this generation was ahead of its time in anticipating the compact crossover trend that would eventually dominate the market."

  - name: "Second Generation"

    end_year: 2022
    description: "After a seven-year hiatus, the HR-V nameplate returned on a completely new vehicle based on the Honda Fit/Jazz platform. Featuring more dramatic styling with a coupe-like roofline and hidden rear door handles, it adopted Honda's 'Solid Wing Face' design language. The Fit's central fuel tank layout and 'Magic Seat' system were carried over, providing exceptional interior versatility with multiple seating configurations and a flat load floor when the rear seats were folded. Engine options varied by market but typically included 1.5L to 1.8L four-cylinder gasoline engines and diesel options in Europe, with hybrid variants available in Japan. The interior offered a more premium feel than the Fit, with better materials and available features including a touch-based climate control system and infotainment display. This generation established the HR-V as a global model in Honda's lineup, capitalizing on the rapidly growing subcompact crossover segment and bridging the gap between the Fit and CR-V."

  - name: "Third Generation (Global except North America)"

    end_year: null
    description: "The current global HR-V (known as Vezel in Japan) features a cleaner design with horizontal lines, a longer hood, and a more upright stance compared to its predecessor. Built on the latest Fit/Jazz platform, it continues to offer the 'Magic Seat' system and exceptional space efficiency. Powertrain options vary significantly by market, with many regions focused on Honda's e:HEV hybrid system that combines a 1.5L Atkinson-cycle engine with electric motors. The interior represents a significant advancement with a more minimalist design featuring a freestanding infotainment display and simplified control layout. Technology includes the latest Honda Sensing safety suite and improved connectivity options. This generation maintains the HR-V's position as a practical, efficient compact crossover while adding more sophistication and electrification options."

  - name: "Third Generation (North America)"
    start_year: 2022
    end_year: null
    description: "The North American HR-V diverged from the global model with its own distinct design built on the Civic platform rather than the Fit/Jazz basis used elsewhere. Significantly larger than both its predecessor and the global model, it features more conventional SUV styling with a prominent grille and horizontal body lines. Without the Fit's 'Magic Seat' system, it offers a more traditional interior layout but with substantially more passenger and cargo space than the previous generation. Powered exclusively by a 2.0L naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine in the United States (with 158 HP) paired with a CVT transmission, it focuses on balanced performance rather than maximum efficiency. The interior shares design elements with the latest Civic, featuring a honeycomb-pattern dash accent and either a 7-inch or 9-inch touchscreen depending on trim level. Standard safety technology includes the full Honda Sensing suite across all models. This North America-specific model repositions the HR-V as a more substantial entry-level SUV, particularly important as the Fit was discontinued in this market, making the HR-V Honda's new entry point for many buyers."
